# fraud_detection_project
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning models trained on fraud detection datasets. It includes a thorough data analysis and preprocessing phase, which involves handling missing values, duplication checks, and feature engineering. The project explores various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Additionally, model explainability techniques such as SHAP and LIME are employed to provide insights into feature importance and ensure model transparency. The project also includes an API deployment phase using Flask and Docker, enabling seamless integration with external applications for real-time fraud detection.
